# Datascience- Final Project

## Project Title : ACCIDENT HOTSPOT DETECTION AND RISK PREDICTION

### Introduction:
This project analyzes road accident data collected over the last five years to identify patterns, assess risk factors, and detect high-risk accident zones. The analysis includes:

Cleaning and pre-processing datasets.

Deriving meaningful features like accident severity and clustering hotspots.

Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize trends.

### Loading Datasets
Dependencies
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

plotly

scikit-learn

Setup

Clone this repository or download the code files.

Upload datasets to your Google Drive for access.

Use Google Colab or a local Python environment.

### Dataset Description
#### 1. Casuality Dataset
Contains details about individuals involved in accidents, including:

Severity

Age group

Gender

Casuality class (e.g., pedestrian, driver)

#### 2. Collision Dataset
Provides location and contextual information for accidents:

GPS coordinates

Date and time

Weather and light conditions

#### 3. Vehicle Dataset
Contains details about vehicles involved:

Vehicle type

Direction of travel

### Project Workflow
#### 1. Importing Libraries
We import essential libraries for data manipulation (pandas), numerical operations (numpy), and visualization (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly). Warnings are suppressed to enhance readability.

##### 2. Loading Datasets
Datasets are loaded from Google Drive after mounting.

#### 3. Dataset Exploration
Basic exploration includes checking the structure, data types, and summary statistics.
